# XcodeRPC

A functional (and somewhat pretty) Discord Rich Presence client for Xcode. Supports the latest versions of Xcode (tested on Xcode-beta 16.0)

Supports **macOS 13.0**. Xcode 14> *should* have the best experience.
Support for older versions of macOS may come further down the line.

It supports using your app icon and displaying it on Discord by uploading it to Imgur. (This functionality can be disabled in a later commit.)

It has icons for the following 20 files (and a default app icon and the Xcode icon).

(As you can see, these icons were all gotten from Xcode 7, as Xcode 16 does not have as easily accessible icons. If anyone finds better icons, a PR is always welcome.)

WIP.

# XcodeRPC

A functional (and somewhat pretty) Discord Rich Presence client for Xcode.

It supports using your app icon and displaying it on Discord by uploading it to Imgur. (This functionality can be disabled in a later commit.)

It has icons for the following 20 files (and a default app icon and the Xcode icon).

(As you can see, these icons were all gotten from Xcode 7, as Xcode 15 does not have as easily accessible icons. If anyone finds better icons, a PR is always welcome.)

WIP.
